Character concept art


Full-body character concept art of the "Rat Queen," a legendary female scavenger. She has an athletic and attractive feminine figure and intense eyes with glowing yellow irises. Her hair is styled in numerous thin, long black-and-grey afro braids, tied back.
Her outfit is a mix of rugged scavenger and tribal aesthetics:
She wears thigh-high leather boots on otherwise bare legs, with a few extra leather straps wrapped around her upper thighs.
Her lower body is covered by a loincloth-like battle skirt made of dark leather panels, which is open at the sides to allow for free movement.
Her torso has a bare midriff, covered only by a rugged leather cuirass (breastplate) with light, matching pauldrons.
A small, ragged fur mantle is draped over one shoulder.
Her bare arms are wrapped in leather straps, and she wears fingerless leather gloves.
She holds a compact, makeshift crossbow. A small scout rat with tiny goggles is perched on her shoulder, and a large, fat porter rat with a backpack sits at her feet.
Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, realistic fantasy art style.


Full-body character concept art of a female scavenger in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. She has an athletic and attractive feminine figure.
Her face is partially obscured by a dark hoodie pulled low and a cloth bandana covering her mouth. She wears a form-fitting but durable outfit of worn cargo pants and a patched-up top. No armor.
She is in a cautious, nimble pose, holding a long, crude knife fashioned from a piece of sharpened scrap metal. On her back is a small, compact leather satchel.
Solid white background for easy removal. Gritty, realistic style, ultra-detailed, 4k.


Full-body character concept art of a legendary, eccentric old scavenger, slightly hunched over. He has wild, manic eyes behind round vintage aviator goggles and a predatory grin that looks at the viewer as if they are a pile of valuable scrap.
He is dwarfed by an enormous, ridiculously oversized backpack made of salvaged metal plates and canvas, overflowing with junk. A small, scruffy dog's head is peeking out from an opening near the top of the pack.
In his hand, he holds a bizarre weapon: a walking cane, but its top has been replaced with a salvaged robotic arm, and its mechanical claw is gripping a large, rusty combat knife.
He wears layers of tattered robes and scavenged tech parts. Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, gritty realistic style.





try to use this face 

Front view, full-body character concept art of a spunky female mechanic scavenger, age 19-20. She has a lean and athletic build with a small bust. Her skin is fair, with a light dusting of freckles across her face, shoulders, and collarbones. 
She has warm brown eyes. Her long red hair is styled in a single, thick, long waist-length braid draped over one shoulder. A few smudges of grease are on her cheek, 
and old workshop goggles are pushed up on her forehead over a patterned yellow bandana that closely matches the color of her pants.
Her outfit is a mix of rugged scavenger and tribal aesthetics:

A tight-fitting black crop top with thin straps, showing her bare midriff.
Baggy, oversized, grease-stained yellow very low-waisted work pants. Very low-waisted pants are held up by a belt, 
causing them to sag on her hips. Attached suspender straps hang loosely along her legs. The wide trouser legs are long, pooling around and completely covering her boots, so that only the steel toes of the heavy work boots are visible underneath.
She wears big, dirty, brownish work gloves with metal plates on the knuckles and a leather tool belt.

She stands in a confident bad-ass pose, her right hand resting on her hip by her tool belt, while her left hand holds a small screwdriver, pointing on something.
Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, realistic fantasy art style.





Cinematic digital painting of a small, established scavenger camp at day time, panoramic wide.
The camp consists of a few large, patched-up canvas tents and one or two simple shacks built from scrap wood and corrugated metal. About a dozen figures are scattered around, some gathered near a large central bonfire, others working on gear.
The camp's perimeter is loosely marked by a pair of derelict, rusty cars placed as a minimal windbreak. The ground is littered with junk, but organized into piles, suggesting a long-term settlement.
The atmosphere is quiet and wary, not bustling. The style is gritty, realistic, and highly detailed.





-----scavengers-----

Full-body character concept art of a young, lean male scavenger, around 20 years old. His lower face is obscured by a faded cloth bandana. 
He wears a dusty, dark hoodie with a single patched tear on the sleeve, over grimy cargo pants tucked into sturdy work boots. 
He wears fingerless leather gloves.
On his back is a medium-sized, functional backpack, with a rolled-up blanket strapped to the side.
He is in a cautious, nimble pose, holding a crude, makeshift knife made from sharpened scrap metal.
Unarmored. Gritty, realistic style, ultra-detailed, 4k. Isolated on a solid neutral grey background.


Full-body character concept art of a grizzled, weather-beaten male scavenger, in his 50s. He wears a long, faded brown duster coat with a large, rough patch on one elbow, over a simple shirt and dusty, stained jeans. 
On his head is a wide-brimmed hat. He has a full beard and a calm, watchful expression.
He leans on a long, makeshift spear. A large, heavy-laden backpack made of canvas and leather sits on the ground beside him, 
with a rusty metal pot hanging from it.
He wears a simple light leather vest over his shirt. Gritty, realistic style, ultra-detailed, 4k. Isolated on a solid neutral grey background.


Full-body character concept art of a male scavenger in his mid-30s, in a low crouch. His face is obscured by a dark scarf and the shadow of his hood. 
He wears practical, dark, oil-stained clothing with reinforced knees, allowing for silent movement.
He is aiming a rugged, functional crossbow. On his back is a well-worn but practical backpack, with a coil of rope attached to the side.
Unarmored. Gritty, realistic style, ultra-detailed, 4k. Isolated on a solid neutral grey background.


Full-body character concept art of a young adult male scavenger, maybe 25 years old. He wears a faded green canvas jacket with grease stains around the pockets, 
and a worn baseball cap turned backwards. His lower face is covered by a simple dust mask.
He stands in a relaxed but alert pose, holding a heavily worn Beretta 92 pistol. He carries a worn sling backpack across his chest that looks full, with a metal canteen clipped to the strap.
Unarmored. Gritty, realistic style, ultra-detailed, 4k. Isolated on a solid neutral grey background.


Full-body character concept art of a thin, wiry male scavenger in his late 40s, wearing old, grease-stained mechanic's overalls.
He is holding a crude, post-apocalyptic pipe gun. The weapon is visibly assembled from mismatched industrial parts: a long, 
thick metal pipe serves as the barrel, the stock is a rough piece of weathered wood, and the trigger mechanism is a crude assembly of exposed springs and levers, held together with bolts and wire wraps.
The rifle looks nothing like a manufactured firearm. No assault rifle, no optical scope, no standard shotgun parts. It is clearly a piece of dangerous junk.
On his back is a large, overstuffed backpack. Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k.

can you reduce the scale of this image to show more of the city about 60 houses instead of 25


An isometric full town map of a medium-sized rural lakeside town, NOT an island. The lake appears only along the bottom 10% of the image; the rest is land. Show the ENTIRE TOWN in a wide-area, zoomed-out, bird's-eye view. The camera angle must be far enough to fit a large portion of the settlement in one frame, with houses appearing small on screen so that the scene includes at least 60–80 of them. Avoid close-up or medium zoom.

Road layout (important):
The town must have ONE main asphalt road running through it, clearly visible and distinct from all other paths. In addition, include only 2–3 very short side streets or dirt/gravel paths. There must NOT be roads circling around each house—reduce the number of roads. Use irregular, organic placement, not a tight grid. Many houses should sit directly beside the main road or be accessible only by narrow footpaths.

Increase the density significantly: include 60–80 houses total, arranged in several dense clusters along the main asphalt road and the few short side paths.

Include a detailed slave market district near the harbor: a large open square with a wooden auction stage, metal cages, and a packed parking lot full of various electric vehicles. Nearby are long worn-down barracks for captives.

Include a harbor with wooden piers, a crane, small fishing boats, storage sheds, and a guard post.

Include a small, ultra-modern genetic scanning station/clinic: a clean white building with external tanks, pipes running toward the lake, a tall antenna tower, turrets, and a landing pad. This building must stand out strongly from the rest of the town.

Include the mayor’s office: a refurbished former military warehouse with reinforced windows and a flagpole.

Include the mayor’s mansion: a large modern, well-maintained house with a pool and a small elite neighborhood of several smaller rich houses.

Make the general store, bar/tavern, and repair shop clearly visible and distinct. Place them along the MAIN asphalt road so they are easy to find. Add service yards, parked electric cars, tool racks, outdoor seating, or small signs to visually differentiate them.

Add architectural variety to the housing: in addition to the common 1–2 floor gable-roof houses, include several more modern homes with flat roofs or single-sloped roofs, metal siding, larger windows, or rooftop solar panels. Mix these styles naturally across the town.

Add subtle low-tech cyberpunk elements: old security cameras, exposed cables, battery packs, improvised lighting, a few small service drones, worn solar panels, old LED signboards.

Style: realistic textures, muted rural tones, high detail, readable isometric game map.
