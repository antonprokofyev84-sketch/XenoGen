Character concept art


Full-body character concept art of the "Rat Queen," a legendary female scavenger. She has an athletic and attractive feminine figure and intense eyes with glowing yellow irises. Her hair is styled in numerous thin, long black-and-grey afro braids, tied back.
Her outfit is a mix of rugged scavenger and tribal aesthetics:
She wears thigh-high leather boots on otherwise bare legs, with a few extra leather straps wrapped around her upper thighs.
Her lower body is covered by a loincloth-like battle skirt made of dark leather panels, which is open at the sides to allow for free movement.
Her torso has a bare midriff, covered only by a rugged leather cuirass (breastplate) with light, matching pauldrons.
A small, ragged fur mantle is draped over one shoulder.
Her bare arms are wrapped in leather straps, and she wears fingerless leather gloves.
She holds a compact, makeshift crossbow. A small scout rat with tiny goggles is perched on her shoulder, and a large, fat porter rat with a backpack sits at her feet.
Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, realistic fantasy art style.

Her face is partially obscured by a dark hoodie pulled low and a cloth bandana covering her mouth. She wears a form-fitting but durable outfit of worn cargo pants and a patched-up top. No armor.

Full-body character concept art of a legendary, eccentric old scavenger, slightly hunched over. He has wild, manic eyes behind round vintage aviator goggles and a predatory grin that looks at the viewer as if they are a pile of valuable scrap.
He is dwarfed by an enormous, ridiculously oversized backpack made of salvaged metal plates and canvas, overflowing with junk. A small, scruffy dog's head is peeking out from an opening near the top of the pack.
In his hand, he holds a bizarre weapon: a walking cane, but its top has been replaced with a salvaged robotic arm, and its mechanical claw is gripping a large, rusty combat knife.
He wears layers of tattered robes and scavenged tech parts. Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, gritty realistic style.
