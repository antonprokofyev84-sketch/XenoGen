Character concept art


Full-body character concept art of the "Rat Queen," a legendary female scavenger. She has an athletic and attractive feminine figure and intense eyes with glowing yellow irises. Her hair is styled in numerous thin, long black-and-grey afro braids, tied back.
Her outfit is a mix of rugged scavenger and tribal aesthetics:
She wears thigh-high leather boots on otherwise bare legs, with a few extra leather straps wrapped around her upper thighs.
Her lower body is covered by a loincloth-like battle skirt made of dark leather panels, which is open at the sides to allow for free movement.
Her torso has a bare midriff, covered only by a rugged leather cuirass (breastplate) with light, matching pauldrons.
A small, ragged fur mantle is draped over one shoulder.
Her bare arms are wrapped in leather straps, and she wears fingerless leather gloves.
She holds a compact, makeshift crossbow. A small scout rat with tiny goggles is perched on her shoulder, and a large, fat porter rat with a backpack sits at her feet.
Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, realistic fantasy art style.


Full-body character concept art of a female scavenger in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. She has an athletic and attractive feminine figure.
Her face is partially obscured by a dark hoodie pulled low and a cloth bandana covering her mouth. She wears a form-fitting but durable outfit of worn cargo pants and a patched-up top. No armor.
She is in a cautious, nimble pose, holding a long, crude knife fashioned from a piece of sharpened scrap metal. On her back is a small, compact leather satchel.

Full-body character concept art of a legendary, eccentric old scavenger, slightly hunched over. He has wild, manic eyes behind round vintage aviator goggles and a predatory grin that looks at the viewer as if they are a pile of valuable scrap.
He is dwarfed by an enormous, ridiculously oversized backpack made of salvaged metal plates and canvas, overflowing with junk. A small, scruffy dog's head is peeking out from an opening near the top of the pack.
In his hand, he holds a bizarre weapon: a walking cane, but its top has been replaced with a salvaged robotic arm, and its mechanical claw is gripping a large, rusty combat knife.
He wears layers of tattered robes and scavenged tech parts. Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, gritty realistic style.



Full-body character concept art of art of a spunky female mechanic scavenger, age 19-20. She has a lean and athletic build with a small bust. Her skin is fair, with a light dusting of freckles across her face and shoulders. Her long red hair is styled in a single, thick, waist-length braid draped over one shoulder. A few smudges of grease are on her cheek, and old workshop goggles are pushed up on her forehead over a bandana.
Her outfit is a mix of rugged scavenger and tribal aesthetics:
Her outfit consists of:
A simple black crop top, showing her bare midriff.
Baggy, oversized, grease-stained yellow bib overalls. The suspender straps are unfastened and hang loosely at her sides.
The trouser legs are wide and rolled up at the cuffs, almost completely obscuring her boots. Only the steel toes of large, heavy work boots are visible from underneath.
She wears, big dirty work gloves and a leather tool belt.

Solid white background for easy removal. Ultra-detailed, 4k, realistic fantasy art style.



Cinematic digital painting of a small, established scavenger camp at day time, panoramic wide.
The camp consists of a few large, patched-up canvas tents and one or two simple shacks built from scrap wood and corrugated metal. About a dozen figures are scattered around, some gathered near a large central bonfire, others working on gear.
The camp's perimeter is loosely marked by a pair of derelict, rusty cars placed as a minimal windbreak. The ground is littered with junk, but organized into piles, suggesting a long-term settlement.
The atmosphere is quiet and wary, not bustling. The style is gritty, realistic, and highly detailed.
